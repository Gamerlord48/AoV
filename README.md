# Angel of Vengeance (Or AoV for short)
  The aim of this Minecraft mod is to be a magic mod, one based around being a Healer.
  Most magic mods I've played dont really go too deep in the healer aspect.
  I will be implementing more than just healer of course, but the main focus is the healer :)

## Classes
  * Healer
    * Healer, main focus is to well.. Heal, yourself, others, and so on. Yes Zombies(Well most undead really) will take damage.
  * Defensive Caster
    * Main focus is to cast buffs/spells to yourself and friends to increase your resistance and protection.
    * It's been requested so I'll be implementing a Dodge system (Base 0%) that will probably only be able to be increased from this class.
  * Offensive Caster
    * Main focus here is to be some sort of divine caster using light/good/lawful based spells against your foes.

## The Skill System
  * What I have planned here is to implement some sort of skill system where you get points slowly from using your spells/abilities.
  * Of course the first thing that comes to mind here is people will grind via spamming spells.
    * Now how do I resolve this? My thoughts are to reduce the amount you progress everytime you use a spell, this eventually resets over time.
    * Also you will only progress if the spells are being used as intended.
  * There will be a max total of points you'll be able to collect and I will try to make it so its not too complicated.
  * Yes you'll be able to do a reset if you didnt like your choices.
    * There will be two types, a full reset and a minor reset.
      * The Full reset takes you back to 1 starting point, this allows you to choose to be another class but you'll have to start from the ground up.
      * The minor reset allows you to just reset your current class, keeping the 1 point spent in it so your unable to change classes, but you regain all your points to spend inside this tree.

## Ideas
  Feel free to submit any ideas as an issue. If I like the idea it'll remain open till it becomes implemented. If I really don't like it I will close it with reasons why, don't take it personally :) It could have to do with balance afterall.

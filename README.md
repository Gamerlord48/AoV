# Angel of Vengeance (Or AoV for short)
  The aim of this Minecraft mod is to be a magic mod, one based around being a Healer.
  Most magic mods I've played dont really go too deep in the healer aspect.
  I will be implementing more than just healer of course, but the main focus is the healer :)

## Classes
  * Healer
    * Healer, main focus is to well.. Heal, yourself, others, and so on. Yes Zombies(Well most undead really) will take damage.
  * Defensive Caster
    * Main focus is to cast buffs/spells unto yourself and friends to increase your resistance and protection.
    * It's been requested so I'll be implementing a Dodge system (Base 0%) that will probably only be able to be increased from this class.
  * Offensive Caster
    * Main focus here is to be some sort of divine caster using light/good/lawful based spells against your foes.

## The Skill System
  * What I have planned here is to implement some sort of skill system where you get points slowly from using your spells/abilities.
  * Of course the first thing that comes to mind here is people will grind via spamming spells.
    * Now how do I resolve this? My thoughts are to reduce the amount you progress everytime you use a spell, this eventually resets over time.
    * Also you will only progress if the spells are being used as intended.
  * There will be a max total of points you'll be able to collect and I will try to make it so it's not too complicated.
  * You begin with 1 point, you are then able to spend this point into one of the 3 class trees. After doing so you become bound to that class and cannot spend points into the other 2 tree.
  * Yes you'll be able to do a reset if you didnt like your choices.
    * There will be two types, a Full reset and a Minor reset.
      * The Full reset takes you back to 1 starting point, this allows you to choose to be another class but you'll have to start from the ground up.
      * Unlike the Full Reset, The Minor reset allows you to keep any skill points you have earned. However, you will not be given the choice to pick another class.

## Ideas
  Feel free to submit any ideas as an issue. If I like the idea it'll remain open till it becomes implemented. If I really don't like it I will close it with reasons why, don't take it personally :) It could have to do with balance after all.
